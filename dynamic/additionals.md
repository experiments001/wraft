## Branding
We strongly believe that any effective design project should start with a definition of what it should be and what it should not be
		
Rebranding will help LawStore to identity, and define characteristics of the brand, and build a strong and consistent visual narratives for the brand - helping brand achieve trust, and instil promise to the user.

The development of this brand will be essential to consistently delivering the right message to the right people to create just the right reaction.

## Design Conversion to Code
It is bad when design get lost in translation - as Product Designers who have hands-on experience with technology, our team can ensure design and its code are exactly the same.
		
We build design components based on the Atomic Design principle, where every elements are classified as Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, and Pages - each of which are independent that can be composed to form any types of page structures, that  acts as source of truth for future development, as well as living style guide for the product.
