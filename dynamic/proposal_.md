# The proposal

This proposal tries to outline our services and nature of the work to design an exceptional design  experience for Lawstore.



## Our Process

Being a product development studio, who are passionate about shipping. We believe in speed, and validation. 

Our product design approach is a combination of Lean UX principles, and Design Sprint, resulting in quick outcomes, and faster validations 

Our team will evaluate the requirement sheet, and gather business goals, user goals, features list, and build user journeys - addressing all major scenarios in which a user might interact with the application. 

## Discovery

Discovery involves conducting inquiry into types of potential users of the application. This involves Strategic Analysis and Planning, Information Architecture, Interaction with potential users and business owners, doing a competitive analysis of the product landscape, talking with stake owners to understand business objectives etc. 

This includes, but not limited to following activities 

1. **Stakeholder Interviews**:
   We will hold discussions_interviews with business stakeholders and other relevant business user groups to clarify the business goals and identify supplemental user information. 

2. **Competitive Analysis**:
   We will review competitor apps to identify where LawStore needs to be positioned within the competitive landscape, work with the team to identify likes, dislikes and opportunities.

3. **Persona Development**: Personas are documents that describe typical target users. With appropriate research and descriptions.

## Define & Prototyping

Based on the discovery, a usable interactive prototype of the application will be developed in close collaboration with LawStore. This enables both parties to put in thoughts and test practical implications and users perspective of the application. We’ll test the applications flow, and usability in different aspects. This includes, but are not limited to following activities: 

1. **User Journey Maps:**
   A time-line of user actions that describes the relationship between your brand and your customers. We will visualise all of a user’s interactions with your product, from their point of view. 

2. **Information Architecture:**
   With use of methods like Card Sorting, we will organise and prioritise contents within the application, making it easier for users to find relevant content. 

3. **Prototyping:** We believe in early prototyping, and validating our assumptions from real users, with prototyping, we will have realistic  understanding of how our users would interact with your application. 

## Designing & Testing

This phase involves building a fully functional design system, Business owners and potential users are given this to test our interactions and the feed backs are validated, and applied on the next iteration. 

1. **Usability Testing:**
   We will organise a set of potential users interact with the app, and take their inputs/feedbacks, also record their experiences. 

2. **Identity:**
   Forming a strong, memorable narrative is critical for thriving businesses, we will work through our process to build and form, identity guidelines for the application which includes Branding, Logo, Colour system etc.

3. **Design System:**
   We thrive to make design persistent, our deliverable will include reusable, components, that makes future product design faster, and maintainable. 

## Front-end Components

In Addition to design services, we will provide designs as HTML/CSS  of the designs, that can be easily be picked up by developers without loosing the design in translation.
