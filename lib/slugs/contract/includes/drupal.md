# Project Overview

This proposal tries to outline our services and nature of the work to redesign an exceptional Online identity and experience for IKSIT Web Site.

## Why do we recommend Drupal?

Drupal is a leading enterprise-level platform for social publishing sites, providing advanced CMS and social capabilities. Plus, Drupal itself demonstrates the value of social community software, being written by a large, global community of developers who are constantly improving and extending it. Building on Drupal’s open source core, we will be able to customize and extend its capabilities to fulfill the specific business needs of IKSIT

The Drupal core combines the capabilities of a content management system with blog, wiki, forums, and custom forms, as shown in Illustration 1. It provides a consistent set of interfaces to support user management and access controls, as well as unified services for managing tagging, taxonomy, ratings, comments and search services.

Thanks to this robust architecture, Drupal has been adopted by many enterprise-level public and privately
owned organizations to project their presence on the web, deliver content to their customers, and manage the
interactive applications that foster community connections. Organizations running Drupal value its flexibility
and its ability to seamlessly integrate with an underlying enterprise infrastructure.
Some ‘famous’ Drupal installations include:

1. http://www.whitehouse.gov/    
2. http://www.amnesty.org/
3. http://www.economist.com/
4. http://www.cnngo.com/

Especially Whitehouse.gov is a unique example that shows how Drupal can bring transparency, participation
and collaboration into the web presence of a government or public organization. In fact, Whitehouse.gov is
sharing several demonstrations of its results of working with Drupal, including:

1. Demonstrating transparency through the IT Dashboard: http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/it-dashboard    
2. Inviting participation through the Open for Questions: http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/OpenforQuestions
3. Fostering the power of collaboration through the Development 2.0 Challenge: http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/Development-2-point-0-Challenge/
