  readers more deeply.
  Functionary Labs is uniquely qualified to help redesign IKSIT, due to our:
* Experience with IKSIT and grid computing communication.
* Expert consulting, creative and development staffs.
* Vast experience working with CMS systems, such as Drupal, to help clients
  achieve strategic goals online.
* Proven record of executing strategic, high-level projects for large, diverse and
  dispersed audiences.

## About Functionary Labs

Founded in 2018, Functionary Labs is is a young and dynamic web agency that specializes in content management and product development solutions. Our team have over 10 years  in implementing CMS solutions for organisations in the public and private sector. We are proficient in standard compliant, accessible website design and obtained several certifications. Furthermore, we have active partnerships with highly valued usability, design and branding experts.



# Project Scope

In this section, we will show in more detail how Functionary can give an answer to all the functional requirements outlined in IKSIT’s request for proposal, including design, template creation, CMS deployment, social media integration, import of existing content and hosting.



## INTERFACE DESIGN & USER EXPERIENCE

Our team is committed to user-centered design, allowing our clients and stakeholders to interact with a prototype (or mock-up) before the start of actual development. This allows us to give form to the functional requirements, affordances and features from a user’s point of view. We experience that our existing clients really value this design methodology, giving them confidence about the project from start and preventing any unexpected outcomes after their investment. During the design process we pay special attention to web accessibility and usability standards, making our web designs easy to read and comprehend by all visitors (humans and search engines) and all devices (PC’s, laptops, tablet PC’s, PDA’s and mobile phones). We make this possible by separating content, presentation and interaction elements, creating valid and clean XHTML code according to the W3C’s Web Content Accessibility guidelines (WCAG). Using our automated testing tools, we track any cross browser issues and fix them before the presentation of our final prototype. This means that our website design will be compatible with the most popular browsers in use: Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera and Chrome. In fact, we will present cross-browser and resolution dependant screenshots of our design together with our final prototype.



## CONTENT MANAGEMENT & PUBLISHING

Drupal, our CMS of choice, is designed from the ground up to manage content for interactive distribution and delivery over the Internet. It manages any type of content running on the web – including web pages, multimedia clips, engineering drawings, maps and other digital formats.



### SHARED REPOSITORY WITH ROLE-BASED SECURITY

Drupal stores content within a shared repository. Content creators, editors, and other end users can check content items into and out of the repository. Drupal detects the interactions and can be configured to ensure that one individual, modifying content stored within the repository, cannot overwrite another person’s contributions. End users can publish content on a web site, without requiring any assistance from web masters or other IT staff members.

### USER MANAGEMENT

Drupal features extensible, flexible, role-based security. - All content items stored within the repository are secured with access rights. Drupal supports granular security down to the node level. - Drupal assigns access rights to both the individual nodes and the containers that collect the nodes (such as folders in a file hierarchy). - Drupal defines roles and, when enforcing a login process, authenticates users to roles. The website administrator can configure the website with the roles and permissions that correspond to the way the organization works. For example a group of writers in a marketing department can have editing privileges for all the text-oriented content they produce and can only access and view the standard product descriptions developed by writers in the engineering department. Website modules can include their own roles and permissions, providing additional flexibility for the underlying security. The roles and permissions for blogging can be defined entirely differently than updating the home page for the corporate web site. Illustration 2 provides an example of the range of permissions and roles available within Drupal.

### INTEGRATED WORKFLOW

We will integrate workflow capabilities, based on Drupal’s user roles and permissions. This will make it possible to describe how a particular type of content needs to move through different workflow states and how individuals in different roles work with the content in these particular states. It is possible to automatically send notifications when workflow states are changed or perform other predefined actions, specified by a business rules engine. Thus for example, it’s possible to implement a press-release review workflow for publishing press releases on the front page:



* A writer can draft the press release and send it to the communications manager for review and approval.

* Once the communications manager approves the press release, it can be forwarded to the legal department, where any one of a group of in-house attorneys can approve it for publication.

* The press release is finally forwarded to the publisher for posting on the appropriate section of the website.



## CONTENT IMPORT & MIGRATION

Depending on the currently used technology, content migration can be fully or semi automated. All data that is stored in a relational database can be automatically migrated to the underlying database used by our proposed CMS. Other content, like documents stored in shared or public folders can be easily migrated to the content management system used by Drupal.



# Project Schedule

Our team is experienced and certified in the SCRUM methodology, which is an agile project management technique. In SCRUM we emphasize communication and collaboration with project owners and other stakeholders. Therefore, we divide the development life cycle into small and easy to manage ‘cycles of work’, typically two weeks in duration. At the end of every cycle we meet with the project owner to review the past work cycle and assign new tasks to the next work cycle. This helps our clients to save time and money, since they are involved in every step of the project. In the case of the IKSIT website, we can break down the project in the following milestones: 

1. Analysis of the functional and design requirements together with IKSIT’s project owners; 

2. Breakdown of the functional requirements into modular elements; 

3. Translation of the navigational structure and modules into a website wireframe; 

4. Creation of a visual design concept based on IKSIT’s design requirements and branding needs; 

5. Presentation of a prototype, consisting of visual design elements, navigational structure, flow diagrams and a detailed description for every module; 

6. Configuration and deployment of Drupal in a test environment; 

7. Customization and template creation to give Drupal the look and feel of our design; 

8. Configuration of security, user management, content management and workflow elements according to the project owner’s requirements; 

9. Integration of social media tools as outlined in the project scope; 

10. Content import and migration; 

11. Technical and functional testing; 

12. Deployment of the final website to our production server; 

13. Performance and load testing; 

14. Website launch


Considering that work starts on the 1st of May 2010, we estimate to deliver the final, tested and deployed product on the 1st of August 2010. This means a project life cycle of 3 months, including sufficient time for testing and revisions.


# PROJECT COSTS

FIXED AND VARIABLE COST ESTIMATES

## SOFTWARE LICENSING COSTS

Taking into account that Drupal is an open source content management solution, there is no software license cost for this product. This is a huge advantage, making more of your budget available for customizing and configuring the CMS to your specific business needs.


## DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

All work provided by Functionary, as well as our partners, will be budgeted at 2000 INR per working hour. Based on an estimate timeframe of 3 months and a workload of one person being fulltime committed to the project for two months and halftime for one month, our total estimate cost for the design, development, content migration, testing and deployment of the project is 560,000 INR
